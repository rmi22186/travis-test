# mParticle JS Web Kit Library

A kit is an extension to the core [mParticle Web SDK](https://github.com/mParticle/mparticle-javascript-sdk). A kit works as a bridge between the mParticle SDK and a partner SDK. It abstracts the implementation complexity, simplifying the implementation for developers.

A kit takes care of initializing and forwarding information depending on what you've configured in [your app's dashboard](https://app.mparticle.com).


## Create Your Own Integration

Detailed instructions on how to implement your own integration with the mParticle Web SDK can be found [here](https://docs.mparticle.com/developers/partners/kit-integrations/web-kit).
